# Day 1 AAS

## GOMAP Splinter Section - Julia Crooke (NASA HQ)
Julia: Program executive for GOMAP

Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)
- Place earth among "a community and continuum of worlds"
- Directly address 2/3's of the 24 key science questions
- UV/VIS spectroscopy of IGM, Circumgalactic Halos
- Must develop mission concept with instrumentation

Program strategies
- Build from pre-decadal studies
- Promote active and inclusive engagements
- 80% of funding goes outside of NASA

Lessons from Past Flagships
- Build to a schedule
- Evolve technlology from JWST, Hubble, Roman flight heritage
- Employ new launch capabilities
- Planned servicing: "mountaintop observatory"
- Robust science & technical margins
- Reduce risk by maturing the whole mission & technologies earlier

Stages
1) HQ preparation
    - Exit Criterion: Policies, procedures, and documents in place to conduct stage 2
2) HWO Maturation Study
    - Missed this
3) Evolved Pre-Phase A HWO (recall: there is a review before going to Phase A)
    - Exit Criterion: Developed STM, NASA Approved
    - Expect to be here in FY28, get input into Astro2030

HWO Maturation Study
- Science, Technology, Architecture Review Team (START)
    - Astro2020 science objectives
    - Mission architecture options
    - Members selected from US STEM communities
    - Interface with STEM community
    - serves under GOMAP HQ Leadership Team
- Lower barriers to participation!!!

Next Steps
- Finalize GOMAP Implementation Strategy
- Develop Terms of Reference
- Missed the rest

S/O To Starlight Suppression Workshop
- Oh you know all of the names on that table

## IDEA & GOMAP: Kartik Sheth (NASA HQ i think)
George Floyd's Murder sparked NASA to update their core values
- Inclusion: _not_ DEI
- Safety
- Integrity
- Excellence
- Teamwork

Increase diversity of thought / backgrounds
- Strategy 4.1
- NASA Equity Action Plan
- "... the pursuit of science, and scientific excellence, is inseparable from the humans who animate it."
- IDEA activities being adopted across SMD
- IDEA criteria added to announcements of opportunity, so it's being used to evaluate proposals

"_You can't be what you can't see, you don't know what you don't know_"

## Speaking on SIG/SAG's
Last two years are some of the most productive ever!
- We bring good news above the fold
- inspiring kids to do science

We need to build a constituency of advocates for science
- GOMAP must be an engine of inclusivity
- Astrophysics with Equity SAG has been created!

Symmetry
- Habitable Worlds Observatory - Hubble
- The X-Ray Observatory - Chandra
- The FIR Observatory - Spitzer

We gotta raise more money!
- Need to double the NASA Astrophysics Budget hehe
- "I am utterly unimpressed" by claims that HWO is absurd

## Impact of Exozodis on Direct Imaging: Chris Stark (GSFC)
Can we subtract exozodi to the poisson noise limit? Time to simulate!
- Coronagraph simulation in Juanola-Parramon et al. (2022)
- Krammer et al (2022) does the PSF subtraction
- LUVOIR-A, B can do it until ~20 zodis
- Exozodi could be so diffuse that you can't tell the disk inclination

Can you do the same thing in the presence of disk structure?
- Mean motion resonant ring structure, worst case scenario!
- Do ADI and high-pass filter, still give residuals that limit SNR of planet
- How does noise from exozodi scale with telescope aperture?
