## MAESTRO - building access and standards for opacity data : Natasha Batalha (NASA Ames)

Opacities are a data product that determine atomic/mollecular absorption

The Need for Opacity Data
- Lots of JWST Cycle 1 observations!
- Large temperature, pressure range
- Interested in super-earths, sub-neptunes

The Hurdle for Supplying Opacity Data
- What line list database do we use?
- Choices made ultimately affect spectra
- What if Data doesn't exist?
- Data is Terabytes-large, how do we transfer / host it?
    - been mailing hard drives, yeesh
    - compression???

The Solution
- MAESTRO
    - Community Standards (uniform metadata, standard data)
    - Compute Opacities
    - NASA hosted database
    - NASA hosted website
- science.data.nasa.gov/opacities/app
- Generate LaTeX tables for your paper!
- You can submit data to `maestro-opacities/submit-data`
    - open-source peer-review through GitHub issues

## Precursor Science Workshop and Proposal Call in support of GOMAP: Eric Smith
ROSES22-D.16 & D.18

Science investigations that will reudce future Great Observatory mission risk and inform mission designs & trades. Decadal survey claimed that we should set up a process to do precursor science.

Precursor Science
- Astrophysics Decadal Survey Precursor Science (ADSPS)
    - supports research in areas related to the recommendations
    - Habitable Worlds Observatory!
    - Others
- Workshops held to gauge science gaps

Radial Velocity
- Extreme Precision Radial Velocity
- Identify future needs of HWO

Pls volunteer to be on review panels if you aren't proposing precursor science.

## Inclusion Practices in Proposals/State of the Profession : Dara Norman (NOIR Lab)
Dara is in Tucson! Consider reaching out to synch up with WiO / Akamai

Astro 2020 formally recognizes DEIA as a need!
- Moral Reasons
    - the itch to do science don't discriminate
- Practical Reasons
    - Ensures better research!

Equity != Equality
- Being fair is more important then being equal
- Focus is on *outcomes*

Policies and Procedures must support IDEA
- Bridge Programs
    - Pro: opportunities!
    - Con: Can promote deficit-minded thinking about minority students
    - Mitigation: Focus on implementation and regular revision
- Dual Anonymous peer-review

Incentives need to be provided!
- Research funding is not tied to metrics or progress on the inclusion of underrepresented and disenfranchised groups
- I feel like this conflicts with self-determination theory

ATP Inclusion Pilot
- Ask to include inclusion plans in research proposals

Study of inclusion plans
- https://baas.aas.org/pub/2022i028/release/1
- Inclusion of good practice != good grade
- How a practice is implemented matters
- Themes that might have high impact were implemented less often in the plans
- Less Impactful statements were frequent
    - DEI credentialing (we have a history of DEI)
    - Code of Conduct
    - Normal Mentoring
- More Impactful 
    - Substantial evaluation plan
    - Cross-institutional partnership
    - Leveraging Partnership for DEI
- did not identify the same critiques as DEI experts, e.g. scientists aren't that good at rating IDEA initiatives

Toolkit of Collaborative Practice
- USELTP, research and inclusion initiative
- database of best practices!
- Go check out Sacco talk on Tuesday Jan 10 10:40am Rm 607

Question & Answer Session
- APRA has inclusion plans, but there is an inconsistency on what should go into a plan. Can we get clearer standards on inclusion plans?
    - Yeah totes, but didn't want people to just regurgetate a rubric
- Can you elaborate on Equity v.s. Equality
    - Dual-Anonymous Review is a good example: you see a difference in women PI getting time on telescopes. But it just takes away the name so people can focus on the science.
    - You could instead elivate under-represented individuals!
    - NOIRLab does a blind stage 1, and then does a stage 2 based on limited background information

## The Habitable Worlds Observatory's Habitable Zone Rocky Planet Goal : Bruce Macintosh & John Fourtney (UCO / UC Santa Cruz)
No longer a part of the decadal survey as of Astro 2020 coming out!

New Title: **The Habitable Worlds Observatory's ~~Habitable Zone Rocky Planet~~ Goal**
- Mission implementation must evolve
- HWOMST
- Factors influencing decadal survey study
    - shadow of JWST over-budget
    - Roman evolving in complex ways
    - reduced uncertainty about astrophysics
    - extensive work on mission maturation program (GOMAP)

Conclusion
- 25 atmospheric spectra
- apprx 6MST with a coronagraph, could launch in 2040's
- Oh deer Jaren would be 40

Mission Costs
- Equivalent to JWST $11 billion FY20

Eta_Earth
- 25 earths can provide robustness against uncertainties in occurence rate
- Could be as much as 50% what we previously thought
- Not nearly the dominant uncertainty
- Looking for spectra
    - UV: O3
    - VIS: O3,O2, H2O
    - NIR: H20, CO2

Conclusions
- Eta_earth margin built into science goal
- 6MST, 11 billiion mission was a good balance of decadal priorities
- Upscoped mission that explodes and is cancelled is a failure
- Cost and schedule envelope is as critical as a science yield
- evolve under GOMAP
