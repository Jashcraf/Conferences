# ExoPAG Day 1

## Opening: Illaria Pascucci (UA)
ExoPAG's goals:
- What science does ExEp care about?
- Assess mission capabilities
- Prioritize new missions technologies

How to participate:
- ExoPAG executive committee exists, runs ExoPAG stuff
- Can subscribe to exopag email: exopagannounce@jpl.nasa.gov
- Join Study Analysis Groups (SAGs)

Recent activities:
- Monthly ExoPAG Exec meetings
- Review / provide inputs to ExEp science gap list
- others I missed

Science Interest Groups (SIG's)
- SIG2 "Exoplanet Demographics"
- SIG3 "Connection with Solar System"

Study Analysis Groups (SAG's)
- shorter term, result in a report
- 17 current, including the Exozodi paper!

## ExEP @ NASA (Hannah Jang-Condell NASA HQ)
Science Mission Directorate -> Astrophysics Division
- **ExEP: Exoplanets** <- that's us!
- PhysCOS: Black holes, neutron stars
- COR: Cosmic origins

NASA HQ Update
- New astrophysics division director: Mark Clampin
- Director of science/exploration at NASA Goddard, JWST project scientist, Hubble ACS director, technology director

Research Program Update
- oscillates between 15-19% selection for XRP
- Proposals now require *inclusion plans*!
- New ROSES-22 Opportunity for precursor science that influences the design of Astro 2020

Exoplanet Missions
- Flagship: Hubble, JWST
- Explorer: Habitable Worlds Observatory
- ESA missions
- CubeSats / smallsats

## ExEP Overview: Gary Blackwood (JPL)
What is the program office and what do we do?
- managed by JPL, extension of HQ, analysis and reccomendations to HQ
- Manage High-contrast imaging testbed, starshade lab, design studio for exoplanet posters
- Selected Roman-CGI during a prior ExoPAG meeting

Habitable Worlds Observatory
- **Phase A**: Formulation, but not before the external review process!
- Important Tech
    - HCI @ Bandwidth, dynamic, IWA-OWA, throughput
    - Stable telescope
    - science targs
    - archives
    - architecture 
    - communications

How can you participate
- Apply to a postdoc damnit

## ExEP Science Update: Eric Mamajeck (JPL)
ExEP Science Plan & Science Gap List ~exist
Science Gap: Difference between knowledge needed to accomplish X and the state of the art.
- Developed 2 new gaps:
    - Impact of stellar contamination on transmission spectroscopy
    - advance biosignature research

ExEP Target List for Precursor & Preparatory Science
- Tier A
    - IWA Constraint: 83 mas (2.4 L/D at 1um for a 6m telescope)
    - Brightness limit: 30.5 mag
    - Contrast limit: 4e-11
    - Disk Criterion: none
- Tier B
    - IWA Constraint: 72 mas
    - Brightness limit: 31 mag
    - Contrast limit: 4e-11
    - Disk Criterion: okay if Ldisk/L <= 10^-4
- Tier C
    - IWA Constraint: 65 mas
    - Brightness limit: 31 mag
    - Contrast limit: 2.5e-11
    - Disk Criterion: all disks okay
