- C/O ratio enhanced

Gravitational Instability - metal content is ~same as host star. Hard to form < 40AU
- C/O ratio is about the same

30 stars with exocomet signals

cold and hot gas may be simultaneously present

JWST observations will allow the search for volatiles that could indicate the presence of exocomets

## Revealing Demographics of Exoplanets in Binary Star Systems: Kendall Sullivan (UT Austin)

Stellar multiplicity limits exoplanet demographics, for reasons. We need precise measurements of the transit & stellar parameters.
- Second star increases flux, but not planet obscuration. "Flux dilution".
- Unresolved systems contain all at once, you aren't retrieving the right parameters.
- Binary star radius distribution is inconsistent with single star observations
